This will be the github repo for my ITDEV162 Project 2. 

I created a web application for a simple employee database. I seeded the database with 4 Employee objects, and added the ability to add more employees. The main employee list html page has the cards for each employee displaying the employee name and id. When you select the card, it will then link to a separate page and display the specific employee wage and hire date accordingly.

The employee addition page uses an angular form to generate a new employee object via an http request. I added a datepicker module for selecting the hiredate. Will work on adding styles to that but running out of time...! Also going to work on the delete employee function but we'll see if I get that done in time before submitting.
